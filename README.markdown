Introduction
------------

_pegdown_ is a pure Java library for clean and lightweight [Markdown][] processing.
It's implementation is based on a [parboiled][] PEG parser and is therefore rather easy to understand and extend.

_pegdown_ is nearly 100% compatible with the original Markdown specification and fully passes the original Markdown test suite.
On top of the standard Markdown feature set _pegdown_ implements a number of extensions similar to what other popular Markdown processors offer.
Currently _pegdown_ supports the following extensions over standard Markdown:

* SMARTS: Beautifys apostrophes, ellipsises ("..." and ". . .") and dashes ("--" and "---")
* QUOTES: Beautifys single quotes, double quotes and double angle quotes (&laquo; and &raquo;)
* SMARTYPANTS: Convenience extension enabling both, SMARTS and QUOTES, at once.
* ABBREVIATIONS: Support for abbreviations in the way of [PHP Markdown Extra][].
* HARDWRAPS: Enables alternative handling of newlines, see [Github-flavoured-Markdown][]
* AUTOLINKS: Enables plain (undelimited) autolinks the way [Github-flavoured-Markdown][] implements them.
* TABLES: Enables support for tables similar to [MultiMarkdown][] (which is in turn like the [PHP Markdown Extra][] tables, but with colspan support).
* HTML BLOCK SUPPRESSION: Suppresses the output of HTML blocks.
* INLINE HTML SUPPRESSION: Suppresses the output of inline HTML elements.

Note: _pegdown_ differs from the original Markdown in that it ignores in-word emphasis as in

    > my_file.txt
    > 2*3*4=5

Currently this "extension" cannot be switched off.


Installation
------------

You have two options:

* Download the JAR for the latest version from the [download page][]. _pegdown_ has a dependency on [parboiled for Java][parboiled], version 0.11.0-SNAPSHOT or later (available from <http://scala-tools.org/repo-snapshots/org/parboiled/>. 
* Point your Maven-compatible build tool to the repository at "**http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases**", group id "**org.pegdown**", artifact "**pegdown**". There may also be snapshot builds available at "**http://scala-tools.org/repo-snapshots**". 


Documentation
-------------

Using _pegdown_ is very simple: Just create a new instance of a [PegDownProcessor][] and call its markdownToHtml(String) method to convert the given Markdown source to an HTML string.

The first time you create a [PegDownProcessor][] it can take up to a few hundred milliseconds to prepare the underlying parboiled parser instance, however, once the first processor has been built all further instantiations will be fast. Also, you can reuse an existing [PegDownProcessor][] instance as often as you want, as long as you prevent concurrent accesses, since neither the [PegDownProcessor][] nor the underlying parser is thread-safe.

See <http://sirthias.github.com/pegdown/api> for the pegdown API documation.
